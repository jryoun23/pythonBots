I was just messing around with tradingview a couple of months back and came accross this. https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/supertrend/
One of the crypto youtubers I watch, PartTimeLarry, d=made a short videoseries document the transition to python and the ccxt exchange package, so i thought it wuld be more fun to follow
along and here we are. I might make a few changes to see if i can get better short term day trading results, but we will see.

I have not used python in a very long time, so I am using this as more of an intro to pandas and dataframes rather than a =n actual trading bot, but maybe it will serve as both.
