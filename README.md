I was just messing around with tradingview a couple of months back and came accross this. https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/supertrend/
One of the crypto youtubers I watch, PartTimeLarry, d=made a short videoseries document the transition to python and the ccxt exchange package, so i thought it wuld be more fun to follow
along and here we are. I might make a few changes to see if i can get better short term day trading results, but we will see.

I have not used python in a very long time, so I am using this as more of an intro to pandas and dataframes rather than a =n actual trading bot, but maybe it will serve as both.

Im not sure how to change the timezone in ccxt or python, but its kind of annoying having it 5 hours behind

Also there is a 6 minute discrepancy between the data im recieving from ccxt and the current real data from coinbase pro. Im not sure if its a dataframe issue and im just truncating the last couple of minutes off, or if this is a real ccxt problem... Anyway...

Soemthing worth looking out for soon is the supertrend variant by Kiannc(?) to be looked up soon... maybe that will be something i implement alone.
